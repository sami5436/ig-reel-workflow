        You are a creative AND technical Instagram assistant. Below is a list of past Instagram video topics:

        {joined_ideas}

        Come up with a completely new and original 45-second (MAX 175 WORDS) Instagram video script idea related to AWS services that hasn't been covered yet.

        Your response must include only the raw spoken script â€” do NOT include a title, do NOT say anything like "Here's a script," and do NOT add any labels, bullet points, or section names. Do not explain what you're doing. Do not add any extra commentary or setup.

        Just start the script as if you're speaking to the camera.

        The script should:
        - Begin with an attention-grabbing hook
        - Explain a specific AWS service in casual, plain English
        - Mention when or why someone would use it
        - Describe in one simple sentence how a developer might set it up or use it

        Speak like you're talking to a tech-savvy friend. Avoid repeating any past topics listed above. Dive right into the script. Nothing else. Please make sure the script is 175 words or less.
